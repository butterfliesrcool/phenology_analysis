**ABSTRACT:** Phenological synchrony enables species to occur when conditions are optimal for survival. While phenological synchrony between butterflies and their host plants has been extensively documented, the importance of phenology in maintaining interspecies interactions, such as mimicry, is less understood. Mimicry occurs when a species (i.e., the mimic) evolves a phenotypic resemblance to an unpalatable species (i.e., the model), resulting in protection against predation for the mimic. Theory predicts that models should emerge seasonally before their mimics to give predators sufficient time to learn, recognize and avoid their aposematic signal (i.e., model-first hypothesis). Here, we use citizen science data from iNaturalist to test these long-standing predictions. To understand how mimicry influences the evolution of phenological strategies, we estimate onset phenology of two model species Battus philenor and Danaus plexippus, and their mimics Limenitis arthemis astyanax and Limenitis archippus, respectively. Our results support the model-first hypothesis and demonstrate that both models emerge significantly before their mimics across large geographic scales. This research highlights a new avenue for using large-scale citizen science datasets to address long-standing questions about how phenology impacts complex ecological interactions.
